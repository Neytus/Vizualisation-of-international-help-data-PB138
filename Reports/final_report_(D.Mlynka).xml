  <para font-size="15pt">At the beginning of the project it was important to
  find out how source files from IATI organization are structured, what data
  is relevant and what we have to use to successfully do the implementation of
  the project. In addition to used financial data from IATI, we also had to
  get data about population for each country. All these information was stored
  on the Internet and the mail goal was design some structure of document,
  which could be easily used in final visualization. That was my major role in
  this project.</para>

  <para>All of IATI data files was well-structured XML with one of IATI
  recommendation or XML schema accessible on their web pages. Find out how
  they are structured and what data are relevant for project was quite easy.
  The only problem was, that UNDP and WorldBank organizations used their own
  file structured, but after consultations with my collaborators I designed
  XML schema what desribes the base of our final data file for visualization.
  Our goal was to provide the opportunity to user to select any country that
  gained some finances from two international organizations and to have the
  opportunity to filter these results by years, compare it and it should be
  user-friendly. The main XML schema purpose is to provide the easy and simple
  model for data to be reached easily in our web application.</para>
