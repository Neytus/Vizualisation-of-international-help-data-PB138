  <para>The main goal of the project was to create a visualization of the gathered data from UNDP and World Bank. The application should allow comparison of donations from these two organizations for different countries.</para>

  <para>As the chosen team leader, my first task was to initialize the project on GitHub repository and update the wiki pages throughout the semester. I have also been responsible for the organization of the team and fulfillment of requirements before every deadline</para>

  <para>My additional role has been Backend Developer (C#). Together with another team colleague I have implemented the extraction of all the necessary data from World Bank and UNDP XMLs - for each transaction made, I had to parse the date, value and alphabetical code of the receieving country and add it into the xml file which contained data about all countries (provided by my colleague).</para>

  <para>The process described above is accessible from the backend app, which has a button "Extract XML data". Using this button also transforms the finalOutput XML file into json format, which is needed for the Frontend web application.</para>
